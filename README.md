This repository contains the Wolfram Mathematica notebook (.nb) file that was used as a computational tool in the paper "Random Spherical Disc--Polygons and a Duality" (Kinga Nagy, Viktor Vígh, 2025).

Run the code by downloading the .nb file and opening it with Wolfram Mathematica or Wolfram Player. Alternatively, we have also provided a .pdf export for easier access.
